Epic 1:
	Implemented testNg.xml	Parametrized driverManager -> Base test and testing.xml
	Added maximize -> Optional
	Allure implemented
		allure-results in target directory so it is erased after each run
	Moved Log.log result to target for same above
	SoftAssert for isCurrentPage();
	Added config directory
	Added pom.xml parameter for testng.xml runner change on pom instead of new profiles
	New maven build descriptions
	CUCUMBER
	Allure + cucumber (half done)

Epic 2:
	Extent reporting option discarded (Allure tiene integracion con jira y extent no, tiene el report mas descriptivo, es mas usado y con mas docu
	DriverManager singleton with threadLocal with background annotation for beforeAll and Before for driver get.
	NOT SO HORRIBLE IMPLEMENTATION FOR DRIVERS FOR CUCUMBER
	Solve double driver instantiation on start
	Conjugate pageObjects and glue
	Architectural notes on “GlueObjects”
	Resolve multiple examples as retries in allure + cucumber
	DataProvider testng

Epic 3:
	Decided to use instances in Step definition classes
	Moved StepDefinitions to test directory and added <scope>test</scope> to cucumber libraries to enforce correct directory usage
	MultiThreading
	Different profiles
	Getting values from xml such as driver and maximize
	Code Formatting
	Added pom properties
	On nested calls @Step notation, allure generates a hierarchy test report
	Generification of profiles in pom
	Simplified xmlValue in CucumberSupport by using System.getProperty()
	Added allure screenshot on failure, categories, executor and environment
	Added general script timeout set by parameter on run

Epic 4:
    Better implementation for allure features in cucumber features files.
    Added documentation on features files + allure integration (check button.feature file)
    Added picoContainers implementation for shared data between steps.
    Added allure logging with steps + log4j file output (check AllureLogger class for more info)
    Added testManager to handle all common behaviors to testNG and cucumber, and param consumption.
    Added screenshot on different parametrized scenarios
    Added log per test in allure
